### BlockScape
- ![Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8a3d5cb-9397-4599-b126-f8d6515f4cfc)
- [Link](https://github.com/SaltyNickel702/BlockScape/)
- C++ voxel renderer built from scratch using minimal libraries and OpenGL
- Procedural World Generation using multiple FastNoiseLite textures and a user inputted seed
- 8 different block types
- Creative and Spectator Modes
- I made the game engine that runs the game

### Madlibs
- C++ console app
- I coded the madlib class logic
- Madlib.h defines the Madlib class, which is used to store madlibs. Inside of the class, there are three c++ vectors, one for sentences, and an input type that gets appeneded between sentences. The third vector is for user inputs that replace the types. To get an output, we loop through the sentence vector, add each sentence to a string, then add the user input, then continue the loop.<br>
- Also added a method that auto-populates the madlib class from a txt file stored in ${ROOT}/madlibs/. Inside of "example.txt", inputed words are signified using [brackets], with the type of word inside of the brackets. To populate the madlib instance, create an instance, and call .getFromFile("example").<br>
- To get userinput, we simply call .getUserInput, which loops through all types, and askes the user for each type of word. The input is then stored in the inputs vector until needed.

- Gravity Simulation java program running in Processing
- Uses position, velocity, and mass to calculate positions of celestial bodies.
- By default runs in real time. Time can be adjusted in timeFlow variable.

- Java app using Processing
- Draws random points along a theoretical political plane (with x and y variables, like social vs capitalist, liberal vs authoritarian), and tallies votes for preplaced canidates using different voting systems.

### Pocket Calculator App
